# labyrinth solver
---
The program can read a whole path of a given labyrinth image (at this moment
it is neccessary to give start point in code also). An input is an image 
with dotted path from the start to the end.


# What is used and how it works?
---
The project is based on graph algorithm called A* algorithm which allows to find the shortest path from point A to B. 
User can click on start point and destiny point. The program will find the closest points to user's input and draw
a path.
